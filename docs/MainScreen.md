On the left side we have a map of the mercenary, on the right - the boots are divided by levels of difficulty. Between them the button 'Duel' - for the possibility of fighting with live players. The character has by default a weapon, the simplest and weakest, it can never fall out of his hands in battle.
Below is a map of the month on which the bosses will be located (5-10 pieces), the active boss can be only one, ie you can beat them clearly in order.

On the sides and bottom of the picture of the character are icons for equipment and weapons, which are obtained from mobs, bosses and duels.
In duels it will be possible to knock out a rag from another player with a chance of 5-35% if the advantage is 1 level then the chance will be 10% and 20%, if the first in 2 levels then the chance will be 8% and 25%, if 3 levels then 5% and 35%). Only wearing clothes and weapons (except for the original (Nubian) weapon) may fall out.

The backpack icon opens your inventory into which the things you knocked out fall, in the inventory menu you can put things on the character, or take them off.
Each character has its own statuses, when creating a character he is given 28 already studied articles and 10 that need to be scattered at your request. Each stat is responsible for different characteristics:
strength - damage,
vitality - HP,
dexirity - increases the chance for the enemy not to hit you
accyracy - increases your accuracy - the chance of hitting the enemy.
In weapons and things there are possible bonuses not only how to become (for example +4 str, +2 acc, etc. but can also be +15 to damage + 5% chance of evasion).
The calculation of damage will have a direct dependence on your strength, and inversely on the strength of the enemy. And so with all the characteristics.

Quality of clothes and weapons:
-Usual
-Unusual
-Rare
-Epical
-Mythical
-Legendary

Ordinary mobs - are divided into 4 levels of difficulty, each of them has a chance to drop clothes according to your level but of different quality.
For example, a simple mob can drop:
20% - ordinary clothes, 5% - unusual, 0.5% - rare
from a regular mob:
10% - ordinary, 12% - unusual, 4% - rare, 0.4% - epic
from a complex mob:
5% - ordinary, 15% - unusual, 10% - rare, 2% - epic, 0.3% - mythical
from the hellish mob:
3% - ordinary, 10% - unusual, 15% - rare, 8% - epic, 1.8% - mythical, 0.3% - legendary.
The chances of mobs should be about the same, according to the bosses, the chance of dropping cool clothes will be much higher.

The bosses will be certain levels such as the first 5lvl, the second - 10, the 3rd - 15, etc.
accordingly, he will have steep elevated statuses (that is, he must be stronger than a normal bot), as well as steep weapons and rags, or partially rags. From the boss falls out not necessarily something that you put on it, it can drop a random piece, the approximate chances:
ordinary rags - 0%,
unusual rags - 35%
rarity - 30%
epic - 25%
mythical - 9%
legendary - 1%.

When a mob loses a battle, a garment with a chance of 5% may fall out of the character, for example, in a battle with a boss - 20% or in a battle with another character described above.
If the boss wins, he can also be killed as many times as he wants to get a drop.

Also, when killing mobs or bosses, the game currency must be paid. this is also necessary because in the bag the player can collect a lot of unnecessary clothes that would be appropriate to sell, later we will add some simple store where you can buy for example health elixirs etc. therefore the currency ha will be established from the very beginning.

By default, the levels of mobs will correspond to the level of the character, respectively, and the characteristics of clothing and weapons that are stretched on them, and accordingly, drop clothes will also have higher characteristics.
You will also need to add an option near the mobs - reduce their level - this is necessary for the case if a character accidentally sold all the clothes, or it will fall out of his clothes in battle and the character does not have the strength to overcome even the weakest bot to continue the game.

You need to create an exp table for each level
1lvl -100 exp
2lvl -250 and so on.
After the character raises the level, he has 5 free points for pumping, he scatters them at will.

With each level the tasks become more difficult, they depend on the level of mobs you compete. If it is a duel then the task is chosen randomly between your level and the opponent's level.
